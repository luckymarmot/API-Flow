/**
 * This is a template to help speed up the writing of a loader.
 *
 * A Loader acts as a sort of helper that digests a file and its possible dependencies into a nicely
 * formatted object that can be easily parsed. It is in charge of resolving dependencies and
 * integrating them correctly in the item that is returned. In its most simple form, a Loader can be
 * a simple `JSON.parse` on a file with no dependencies.
 *
 * For example, the swagger format allows paths to be defined in multiple files, with the main file
 * holding references to these externally defined files. In addition, it allows one to implicitly
 * define a host, port and basePath based on the origin of the main file. The Swagger Loader will
 * therefore try to resolve every reference to external paths it encounters, as well as making
 * the host, port and basePath explicit in the main file, if they are not present. This reduces
 * greatly the complexity of the checks that need to be done in the parser.
 *
 * Another example would be the Postman collection v2 format, where the schema is very very
 * permissive in terms of what is considered valid (e.g. a request can be a string representing a
 * URL or it can be an object with a `url` field that can be a string or an object that optionally
 * contains `protocol`, `domain`, `port`, `path` and `query` objects or strings). Additionally,
 * the actual implementation, while valid from a strict json schema point of view, is semantically
 * in contradiction with the format on certain points, with, for instance, a `host` field instead
 * of the `domain` field specified in the spec. All this makes it quite complex to manipulate
 * postman collections. The Postman Collection v2 Loader helps resolve this issue, by normalizing
 * the format (e.g. every string is transformed into its more descriptive object representation).
 *
 * If there are aspects of your format that can be polymorphic, or if your format can be decomposed
 * between multiple files, it is recommended that you normalize it in the Loader for your format.
 *
 * Additionally, you can also define Loaders for non-core files (e.g. files that cannot be parsed
 * alone, but are referenced in core format files)
