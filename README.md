# API-Flow

A flow written in ES6 using Immutable to convert between API description formats (Swagger, etc.) and other programs such as cURL command lines.

## Format Support

We currently support:

- Swagger v2.0 (in/out)
- RAML v1.0 (in/out)
- Postman Collection v2.0 (in/out)
- Paw v3.1 (in/out)

We intend to support:

- Swagger v3.0
- RAML v0.8
- Postman Collection v1.0
- Postman Dump v1.0
- Insomnia v3.0
- API Blueprint
- and many more.

## Installation

You can install this library in two different ways.


### Install via NPM/Yarn

```shell
$ yarn add api-flow
# or
$ npm install api-flow
```

### Install from source

Just run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/luckymarmot/API-Flow.git
cd API-Flow
yarn install
make
```

This will install the node module dependencies, but you will need to build API-Flow for the different [environments](src/environments) that you need:

```sh
# use TARGET="node" if you only want the node library
make runners TARGET="node web webworker"
```

You can use the following command to compile different extensions.

```sh
# use TARGET="swagger" if you only want the swagger bindings
make transfer TARGET="swagger raml1 postman2"
```

## Usage

### Standard Library

```js
const ApiFlow = require('api-flow').default; // if from yarn/npm
const ApiFlow = require('./dist/node/api-flow.js').default; // if from `make runners TARGET="node"`

const path = require('path');

const options = {
    source: {
        format: 'swagger',
        version: 'v2.0'
    },
    target: {
        format: 'raml',
        version: 'v1.0'
    }
}

const promise = ApiFlow.transform({
  options,
  uri: path.resolve(__dirname, './my_super_swagger.yml')
})

promise.then((data) => {
  // do some cool stuff with the data
})
```

### User Interface

API-Flow is one of the main components of [Console.REST](https://github.com/luckymarmot/console-rest). If you're an API user, you can easily use [https://console.rest/](https://console.rest/) to convert API description files. If you're an API provider, you can add a button to your API docs to let your users open and play with your API in client apps including Paw or Postman.

## Contributing

PRs are welcomed!
Our sole requirement is that organizations that want to extend API-Flow to support their format write both a parser and a serializer, and not simply a serializer.

## Documentation
You can find more information about the internal structure of API-Flow in [src](https://github.com/luckymarmot/API-Flow/tree/develop/src). We've also created a set of templates to help speed up the extension process: [loader](https://github.com/luckymarmot/API-Flow/tree/develop/src/loaders/template/v1.0), [parser](https://github.com/luckymarmot/API-Flow/tree/develop/src/parsers/template/v1.0/), and [environment](https://github.com/luckymarmot/API-Flow/tree/develop/src/environments/template)
